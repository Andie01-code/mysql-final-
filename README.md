Complete Library Management System Database

Description
This project is a comprehensive relational database for a library management system built entirely with MySQL. It tracks all essential library operations including:

Book catalog with detailed information (title, ISBN, publisher, edition, etc.)

Author and publisher information

Library member management

Book loans and returns

Reservations system

Fine calculation for overdue/lost books

Staff management

Audit logging for all database changes

The database enforces data integrity through proper constraints (PK, FK, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK) and establishes all necessary relationships (1-1, 1-M, M-M) between entities.

How to Set Up the Project
Prerequisites:

MySQL Server installed (version 5.7 or higher recommended)

MySQL client/workbench (like MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or command line)

Installation Steps:

Save the provided SQL script as library_management_system.sql

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Library Management System ERD

(Note: This is a placeholder description. For an actual ERD, you would include a screenshot from your database modeling tool or a link to a hosted image of your diagram created with tools like MySQL Workbench, Lucidchart, or dbdiagram.io)

Key relationships shown in the ERD:

Members can have many Loans (1-M)

Books can have many Loans (1-M)

Books can have many Authors and Authors can have many Books (M-M via junction table)

Each Loan can have one Fine (1-1)

Books belong to one Publisher (M-1)

Additional Features
Data validation through CHECK constraints

Automatic audit logging

Optimized indexes for performance

Comprehensive status tracking for loans, reservations, and fines
